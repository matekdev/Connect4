# Connect4
After I finished my first introduction to C++ course I decided to apply my skills in a different enviroment. Using the application Superpowers
I was able to create models and texture within the program itself. Then using the built in typescript language I used the knowledge
from my first programming course to program the rest. Specifically, how to manage a 2d array and check for various inputs. It is playable at https://mzegar.itch.io/connect4
